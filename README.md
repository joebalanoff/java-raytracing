# Java Raytracer

This is a simple Java raytracer that renders 3D scenes using ray tracing techniques. It creates realistic images by simulating the physics of light as it interacts with objects in the scene. The raytracer supports basic objects like spheres and planes, as well as materials with diffuse and specular properties.

## Features

- Rendering of 3D scenes using ray tracing.
- Support for spheres and planes as scene objects.
- Materials with diffuse and specular properties.
- Reflection and shading effects for realistic rendering.
- Basic keyboard controls for camera movement.

## Controls

- W: Move the camera forward.
- S: Move the camera backward.
- A: Move the camera left.
- D: Move the camera right.
- Space: Ascend (move camera upward).
- Ctrl: Descend (move camera downward).
